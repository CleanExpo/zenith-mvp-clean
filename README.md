# Zenith MVP - Clean Slate

A minimal viable product for the Zenith Platform, built from scratch to establish a clean deployment pipeline.

## Current Status

- ✅ Minimal Next.js 14 app with TypeScript
- ✅ Single API endpoint (/api/health)
- ✅ Zero external dependencies (only Next.js, React)
- ✅ Clean build with no errors

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Minimal app deployment to Vercel
2. **Phase 2**: Add basic website analyzer functionality (no database)
3. **Phase 3**: Add database integration
4. **Phase 4**: Add authentication
5. **Phase 5**: Incrementally add features

## Project Structure

```
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout
│   ├── page.tsx        # Homepage
│   └── api/
│       └── health/     # Health check endpoint
│           └── route.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── next.config.js
└── README.md
```

## Why This Approach?

Starting from scratch allows us to:
- Identify exactly where deployment issues occur
- Build a clean, maintainable codebase
- Add features systematically with full testing
- Maintain control over the deployment pipeline
